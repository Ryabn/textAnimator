# Updated plan

Turns out, there is a library that can convert text straight into svg files. The thing is, it's hosted on npm and it's not optimized for just injecting into my html with a script tag and I'm pretty sure RequireJS is a way of the past. I'm currently picking up Webpack and figuring out how to make it work with my project.

## Using Webpack

I completely changed up my file system since I believe the way webpack works is that it will generate a js file for me that has everything worked out. I managed to make webpack work for my own script file but I'm trying to work out the kinks for important a library for webpack.
